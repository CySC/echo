# echo
A repository of echo programs in different languages

This is mainly built to support websocketd benchmarking  using different languages(although results may be as anticipated) by echoing timestamps to be used for roundtrip time calculation. 
It can also be used for any reason.All apps in this repo read from stdin and print to stdout.
